# Note Taker

## Description

Here is a simple webpage to display your thoughts or lists! I got the idea from using the notes app on my phone and wanted to make something similar to it as a webpage!

- I wanted to make something to introduce me to Express.js
- This was a simple project I could use to make an area for my chaotic thoughts.
- It was very beneficial in teaching me how to navigate and use Express.js

## Installation

To install just fork the code, open a terminal, do an "npm install", then follow that with a "npm start".

## Usage
